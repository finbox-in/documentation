# Bank Connect: Introduction
The FinBox Bank Connect parses bank account statements (PDFs) and provides:

- User Identity data
- Enriched Transaction data
- Fraud Detection
- Credit Assessment metrics (Asset Report)

Developers can use this to build loan application journeys, wealth management apps and personal finance management apps.

Other than parsing bank account statements it also provides client libraries to accept the statement PDFs manually or via net banking credentials.

### Accepting Bank Statements <Badge text="New" type="tip"/>
Other than APIs and libraries to upload and process bank statement PDFs, Bank Connect also provide client libraries for accepting the PDF files from user, both manual as well as through **Net Banking**.

In the **Net Banking mode**, users just have to enter net banking credentials, and the statements will be directly/automatically fetched from their net banking accounts, saving them a lot of time and effort to download/obtain the PDF File.
