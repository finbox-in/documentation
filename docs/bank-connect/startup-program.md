# FinBox Startup Program

## What is the FinBox Startup Program?
Our mission is to democratize financial services for the next billion Indians. We realized that the infrastructure for distribution and access to financial services in India is broken and we are fixing it one API at a time. Through FinBox Startup Program, we want to support other early-stage FinTech companies who are building financial services and products for the next billion Indians.

### Eligibility
We wish to enable early-stage companies to seamlessly collect financial data, critical to building user-centric FinTech products. The program is open to any early-stage startup that meets the following eligibility requirements:
- Incorporated less than three years ago
- Raised no further than Series A in total funding
- haven’t previously received other FinBox offers or discounts

### Benefit
The FinBox Startup Program includes FinBox’s Startup Deal on BankConnect solution - Participating **startups receive $500*** in credit toward our monthly usage plan for up to 3 months as long as they meet our eligibility requirements.


FinBox’s BankConnect solution parses bank account statements (PDFs) and provides:
1. User Identity data for Account Authentication, 
2. Enriched Transaction data, 
3. Fraud Detection, and 
4. Credit Assessment metrics (Asset Report) for Loan Underwriting.

Developers can use this to build loan application journeys, wealth management apps and personal finance management apps. 

Other than parsing bank account statements it also provides client libraries to accept the statement PDFs manually or via net banking credentials. You can learn about BankConnect solution [here](/bank-connect).

_* can vary based on affiliated accelerator and VC partners._
