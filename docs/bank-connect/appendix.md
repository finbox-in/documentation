<!-- ## What is the FinBox Startup Program?
Our mission is to democratize financial services for the next billion Indians. We realized that the infrastructure for distribution and access to financial services in India is broken and we are fixing it one API at a time. Through FinBox Startup Program, we want to support other early-stage FinTech companies who are building financial services and products for the next billion Indians.

### Eligibility
We wish to enable early-stage companies to seamlessly collect financial data, critical to building user-centric FinTech products. The program is open to any early-stage startup that meets the following eligibility requirements:
- Incorporated less than three years ago
- Raised no further than Series A in total funding
- haven’t previously received other FinBox offers or discounts

### Benefit
The FinBox Startup Program includes FinBox’s Startup Deal on BankConnect solution - Participating **startups receive $500*** in credit toward our monthly usage plan for up to 3 months as long as they meet our eligibility requirements.


FinBox’s BankConnect solution parses bank account statements (PDFs) and provides:
1. User Identity data for Account Authentication, 
2. Enriched Transaction data, 
3. Fraud Detection, and 
4. Credit Assessment metrics (Asset Report) for Loan Underwriting.

Developers can use this to build loan application journeys, wealth management apps and personal finance management apps. 

Other than parsing bank account statements it also provides client libraries to accept the statement PDFs manually or via net banking credentials. You can learn about BankConnect solution [here](/bank-connect).

Interested companies can apply [here](https://finbox.in/startup-program/).

_* can vary based on affiliated accelerator and VC partners._


## Frequently Asked Questions
**How are the FB credits applied?** Credits are applied to your monthly bill as per usage bases, covering up to $500 in total usage up to 3 months. Any additional usage costs are not covered by the program.

**How do I redeem the FinBox credits?** Eligible startups can apply directly to the FinBox Startup Program.

**How do I find out if I’ve been accepted to the FinBox Startup Program?** If you’ve been accepted to the program, you’ll receive the status of the application via email with a welcome message and the next steps. If you haven’t received an email, you can also check in your FinBox Dashboard portal and look for a Startup Program icon in the top right corner.

**Where can I view the credits applied to my FinBox account?** The Startup Program credits are reflected in the Dashboard usage and billing page.

**What happens if I go over my total credit applied?** When you reach 80% of credits, you will get a reminder to upgrade it, failing which you will lose access once you exhaust your total credit received as part of the Startup Program offer. 

**What happens when my credits expire?** Once you’ve used your total credits, you might be eligible to renew your contract at a discounted rate. Further commercials will include a monthly minimum commitment on monthly billing based on usage needs. Any existing balance will be adjusted in consequent billings.
