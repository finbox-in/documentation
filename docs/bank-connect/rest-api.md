# BankConnect: Fetching Enriched data using REST API
BankConnect REST APIs can be used to fetch enriched data for an entity. This guide first lists some basic fields like [Progress](/bank-connect/rest-api.html#progress-field) and [Fraud](/bank-connect/rest-api.html#fraud-field), and then explores different enriched data APIs.

You can also try these APIs on Postman. Check out [this](/bank-connect/#postman-collection) article for more details.

To know how to upload statements using REST API, check out [this](/bank-connect/#upload-rest-api.html) article.

:::warning Request Format
BankConnect accepts all requests with form fields, so please make sure that all requests must be made with content-type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data; boundary={boundary string}`
:::

## Authentication
FinBox BankConnect REST API uses API keys to authenticate requests. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

To make a successful request, required **headers mentioned with each API** must be present in the request.

In case wrong/incomplete/no keys were passed in headers, response will have **401** HTTP Code and payload as follows:
```json
{
    "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

## Progress Field
When a statement is uploaded, identity information and basic fraud checks happen at the same time. However other statement analyses, like transaction extraction, salary, recurring transactions, advanced fraud checks, enrichment happen in parallel. Hence all the GET APIs for these **analysis fields** have a `progress` field. You can track the progress of a statement uploaded using this.

`progress` is an array of objects. Each object represents a statement and has the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `status` | String or `null` | Indicates the progress for a statement, and can be `processing`, `completed` or `failed`|
| `statement_id` | String | Identifies a statement uniquely |
| `source` | String | Indicates the source by which the PDF came from. Can be `online` (Net Banking Mode) or `pdf` |
| `message` | String or `null` | An additional message about the progress of the statement |

Sample `progress` value:
```json
[
  {
    "status": "completed",
    "message": null,
    "statement_id": "some_uuid4_1",
    "source": "pdf"
  },
  {
    "status": "processing",
    "message": null,
    "statement_id": "some_uuid4_2",
    "source": "online"
  }
]
```

::: warning TIP
A general rule of thumb would be to make sure all objects in the `progress` field have their `status` as `completed`, by polling the required analysis field API in intervals. As soon as all statuses are `completed`, the same API will give the correct required values.

It is to be noted that `status` for all different analysis APIs are separate, that is identity and progress might have different statuses for the document, depending on whichever is taking less or more time. So make sure to check the status for each of the analysis API before trying to use the extracted values.
:::

## Fraud Field <Badge text="beta" type="warn" />
In all of the analysis field APIs (transaction, accounts, etc.), there is a field `fraud` present, that holds an object with two fields:
- `fraudulent_statements`: array of `statement_id`s which have some sort detected after analysis or in first basic check)
- `fraud_type`: array of fraud objects having following keys:
    | Key | Type | Description |
    | - | - | - |
    | `statement_id` | String | Specifies the statement id for statement-level fraud. In case of account-level fraud, its value is `null` |
    | `fraud_type` | String | It indicates the fraud type |
    | `transaction_hash` | String | Specifies the transaction hash in case of transaction-level fraud, will be `null` otherwise |
    | `account_id` | String | Indicates the account id |
    | `fraud_category` | String | Indicates the fraud category |

:::tip NOTE
To know more about fraud categories and fraud type, refer to [Fraud](/bank-connect/fraud.html) section.
:::

Sample `fraud` field value:
```json
{
    "fraudulent_statements": [
        "uuid4_for_statement"
    ],
    "fraud_type": [
        {
            "statement_id": "uuid4_for_statement",
            "fraud_type": "some_fraud_type",
            "account_id": "uuid4_for_account",
            "fraud_category": "some_fraud_category",
            "transaction_hash": null
        }
    ]
}
```

## List Accounts

The response fields are the same as in [List Accounts](/bank-connect/rest-api.html#list-accounts), but there are two additional fields `credit_transactions` and `debit_transactions` that holds an array of **recurring transaction set** objects for credit and debit transaction type respectively.
Each of the recurring transaction set object has the following fields:
- `account_id`: unique UUID4 identifier for the account to which transaction set belongs to
- `start_date`: the start date for the recurring transaction set
- `end_date`: end date for the recurring transaction set
- `transaction_channel`: transaction channel in upper case. Refer to [this](/bank-connect/appendix.html#transaction-channel) list for possible values.
- `median`: median of the transaction amounts under the given recurring transaction set
- `clean_transaction_note`: contains a clean and small transaction note, it can be used as an identifier for source/destination for the recurring transaction set
- `transactions`: list of transaction objects under the recurring transaction set. Each transaction object here has the same fields as the transaction object in transactions API (Refer the response section [here](/bank-connect/rest-api.html/#transactions) to know about the fields).

<!-- ## Transactions in Excel Workbook <Badge text="New" />
Get **enriched transactions** and **monthly analysis** for a given entity **account wise** in .xlsx (Excel workbook) format.

::: tip Endpoint
GET **{{$page.frontmatter.base_url}}/{{$page.frontmatter.version}}/entity/`<entity_id>`/raw_excel_report/**
:::

### Authentication
Request headers `x-api-key` with API Key as value and `server-hash` with Server Hash as value must be present in request.

### Response
On fetching information successfully, the response would be of the following format with **200 HTTP code**:
```json
{
    "entity_id": "uuid4_for_entity",
    "progress": [
        {
            "status": "completed",
            "message": null,

            "account_id": "uuid4_for_account"
        }
    ]
}
```

The list value of `reports` key will be empty if any one of the statements have the `status` value other than `completed` in `progress`. When the transactions are successfully processed for all statements, within the entity, a list of report links will be available account wise.

In the case of multiple accounts within the same entity, you can have multiple reports within the `reports` key. The `account_id` will represent the account for which the report is, while the `link` key holds URL for the **.xlsx file**. The link will be active only for **1-hour**, post which the API has to be re-hit to obtain the new link.

The Excel workbook will contain three worksheets, first containing the extracted information like Account Holder's Name, Bank, Account Number, Missing Periods, Available Periods, etc., the second sheet contains the enriched extracted transactions for the account, and the third sheet contains the monthly analysis for the account. -->
