# DeviceConnect: Introduction
DeviceConnect is an alternate scoring platform that lets businesses get access to enriched mobile device data of customers to build lending, wealth management and insurance apps. This is especially useful when borrowers are new to credit or are thin-file customers, as it helps them get better interest rates, look up periods, higher amounts and more based on the shared data. In addition to it, our product can give deeper insights on borrowers who has good credit score.

Our product can also be used to create early warning system, perform prioritization and explore cross sell possibilities for your digitally acquired portfolio.
