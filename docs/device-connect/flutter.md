# DeviceConnect: Flutter

The DeviceConnect SDK enables the collection of anonymized, non-PII data from user devices, ensuring compliance with privacy policies by obtaining explicit user consent before initiating data sync processes.

## Requirements

Device Connect Flutter SDK works on Android 5.0+ (API level 21+), on Java 8+ and AndroidX. In addition to the changes, enable desugaring so that our SDK can run smoothly on Android 7.0 and versions below.

```kotlin
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        // Minimum 5.0+ devices
        minSdkVersion(21)
        ...
    }
    ...
    compileOptions {
        // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
        // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    // For Kotlin projects
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
    }
}

## Add Plugin

Specify the following in `local.properties` file:
  
  ```properties
  ACCESS_KEY=<ACCESS_KEY>
  SECRET_KEY=<SECRET_KEY>
  DC_SDK_VERSION=<DC_SDK_VERSION>
  DC_FLAVOR=<DC_FLAVOR>
  COMMON_SDK_VERSION=<COMMON_SDK_VERSION>
  COMMON_FLAVOR=<COMMON_FLAVOR>
  LOGGER_SDK_VERSION=<LOGGER_SDK_VERSION>
  ```

Add plugin dependency in `pubspec.yaml` file:

  ```yml
  finbox_dc_plugin: any
  ```

::: warning NOTE
Following will be shared by FinBox team at the time of integration:

- `ACCESS_KEY`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `DC_SDK_VERSION`
- `DC_FLAVOR`
- `COMMON_SDK_VERSION`
- `COMMON_FLAVOR`
- `LOGGER_SDK_VERSION`
- `CLIENT_API_KEY`
:::

## Create User

To create a user, call the `createUser` method with the following arguments:

- Client API Key
- Customer ID

::: danger IMPORTANT
- `CUSTOMER_ID` Must be **alphanumeric** (no special characters).
- Should not exceed **64** characters.
- Must not be `null` or an empty string `""`.
:::

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.createUser("CLIENT_API_KEY", "CUSTOMER_ID").fold(
    (left) => {
          // Authentication failed
          print("Error Code $left")
        },
    (right) => {
        // Authentication is success
        print("Access Token: $right")
    });
```

You can read about the errors in the [Error Codes](/device-connect/error-codes.html) section.

## Start Periodic Sync

The startPeriodicSync method should be invoked only after receiving a successful response from the `createUser` method callback. This method initiates background syncing for all data sources based on the permissions granted by the user. Data is synced at regular intervals in the background, ensuring continuous and seamless data collection.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.startPeriodicSync();
```

::: tip RECOMMENDATION
To handle cross-login scenarios:

When a user logs back into the app with fresh credentials:
- Call the `createUser` method to register the new user.
- Follow it by `startPeriodicSync` to resume data syncing for the new user.
Even though the SDK automatically adapts to a new user, this approach minimizes potential delays in syncing during the first session
:::

## Match Details on Device

Device matching enables additional pattern recognition to match email, phone numbers and name. The matching happens on the device and the user phone numbers, email addresses won't leave the device.

Call `setDeviceMatch` method before starting the syncs.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.setDeviceMatch("useremail@gmail.com", "Full Name", "9999999999");
```

## Forward Notifications to SDK

Certain phone manufacturers, implement aggressive battery optimization features that kill apps running in the background after a certain period of inactivity. This can prevent the DeviceConnect SDK's continuous syncing from functioning properly, as it relies on background data collection. In such cases, FinBox’s server may need to request data from the SDK when continuous sync has stopped.

To enable this functionality, we use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) notifications process. Forwarding these notifications allows the app to "wake up" if it has been killed by the device’s background processes, ensuring continuous data collection. When the app receives an FCM notification, it "wakes up" and continues collecting the necessary data for integration.

Add the following lines inside `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage.listen` method.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.forwardFinBoxNotificationToSDK(event.data);
```

## Multi-Process Support

DeviceConnect uses a content provider to auto initialize the SDK. The limitation with the OS is that content providers are only initialized once in a **multi-process application** and from the main process. For this reason, any calls to the SDK from other processes will lead to unstable behavior.

In case, you want to use the Flutter SDK from a process other than the main process, follow the two steps mentioned below to initialize the SDK.

### Remove the Content Provider

Remove the content provider that auto initializes the SDK from the Android Manifest file.

```xml
<provider
    android:name="in.finbox.mobileriskmanager.init.AutoInitProvider"
    android:authorities="in.finbox.lenderapplication.riskmanagerprovider"
    android:enabled="true"
    android:exported="false"
    tools:node="remove" />
```

### Initialize the SDK

Initialize the FinBox Flutter SDK in the `onCreate` method of FlutterApplication class.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.initLibrary(this)
```

## Cancel Periodic Sync

Make sure to cancel data synchronization tasks when the user logs out of the app by using the `stopPeriodicSync` method. This ensures that no background sync operations continue unnecessarily, maintaining data security.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.stopPeriodicSync();
```

## Handle Sync Frequency

By default sync frequency is set to **8 hours**, you can modify it by passing preferred time **in seconds** as an argument to `setSyncFrequency` method once the user is created.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.setSyncFrequency(12 * 60 * 60);
```

## Reset User Data

If you need to clear a user's data stored on the device and initiate a fresh data sync, use the `resetData` method. This ensures that all previous data is removed, and syncing starts from scratch.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.resetData();
```

## Forget User

If a user requests to be forgotten, use the `forgetUser` method. This will delete all user details from our system, ensuring this meets digital guidelines for right to be forgotten.

```dart
FinBoxDcPlugin.forgetUser();
```

::: tip RECOMMENDATION
-  When a user logs out, call both `stopPeriodicSync` and `resetData`  to:
    * Stop any ongoing periodic sync processes.
    * Clear existing user data.
   This approach ensures a clean state before the next user session.
