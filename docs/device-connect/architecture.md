# DeviceConnect: Architecture

 With its robust architecture, DeviceConnect empowers you to harness powerful insights and predictive features without compromising user privacy.

**Here’s what you’ll achieve with DeviceConnect** :

* **Anonymized Data Collection**: Gather secure, non-PII data from your app users.
* **Real-Time Insights**: Leverage FinBox’s advanced feature engine to access actionable scores and predictions.
* **Privacy-First Design**: Built to comply with stringent privacy standards, ensuring no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stored or shared.

**How DeviceConnect Works** :

The SDK is integrated into your app and initialized using a unique custom hash generated by your system for each user. This hash is only mapped within your system. The SDK securely syncs anonymized user data to FinBox servers, tagged to the custom hash. The raw data is processed into structured data and stored in the FinBox Data Lake. Raw data is automatically deleted within 24 hours. You request features and scores via the Insights API using the custom hash. FinBox processes the data to generate features and scores, delivering them back to you within seconds.
