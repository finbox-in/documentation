<h2>Technical Verification Workflow</h2>

<p>
The BCM identifies the un-initiated <strong>Technical verification</strong> task
in the <strong>Verifications</strong> tab and initiates it.
</p>

<h3>Workflow Sequence</h3>
<p>
<strong>BCM → Technical Vendor (out of scope) → State-level Technical Manager</strong>
</p>

<h3>Task Initiation and Assignment</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The BCM procures the technical report from a technical vendor outside the
    system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Uploading the technical report is <strong>mandatory</strong> at the time of
    assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BCM assigns the task to a state-level technical manager by selecting the
    appropriate manager from a list mapped to the relevant state.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once assigned, the task appears in the technical manager’s queue.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Manager Review</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Review the uploaded technical report and supporting documents</li>
  <li>Optionally upload additional documents</li>
  <li>Add remarks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Decision Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Recommended</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Not recommended</strong></li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hold</strong> – sends the task back to the same BCM for clarification,
    after which the BCM can resubmit the task with updated documents or remarks
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Decision Rules and Visibility</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Once recorded, the decision is <strong>final</strong> and cannot be modified.
  </li>
  <li>The technical verification task cannot be reopened.</li>
  <li>
    The decision does <strong>not block</strong> the underwriting flow.
  </li>
  <li>
    All uploaded documents are visible:
    <ul>
      <li>Within the technical verification task</li>
      <li>
        Under <strong>“Technical verification”</strong> in the
        <strong>“All documents”</strong> tab
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Complete task movement and remarks are trackable in the
    <strong>“Timeline”</strong> sub-tab.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Dual Technical Verification</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    For requested loan amounts <strong>≥ ₹15 lakhs</strong>, two separate
    technical verifications by two different vendors are required.
  </li>
  <li>
    In such cases, the BCM sees two un-initiated technical verification tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Both tasks can be assigned to the same state-level technical manager; the
    workflow for each remains identical.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BCM compares both technical reports and identifies the
    <strong>lower collateral value</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The BCM manually updates this value in the
    <strong>“Total property value”</strong> field on the
    <strong>Collateral</strong> tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    This comparison and update is <strong>not system-driven</strong> currently.
  </li>
</ul>
