<h2>Primary Verifications</h2>

<p>
In the <strong>“Verifications”</strong> tab, under the
<strong>“Primary verifications”</strong> sub-tab, the BCM completes all primary
verification activities.

<h3>Mandatory Primary Verification Forms</h3>
<p>All of the following forms are currently mandatory:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Residence verification</li>
  <li>Property verification</li>
  <li>Family tree</li>
  <li>Personal discussion – for the applicant and all co-applicants</li>
  <li>Tele-verification – for the applicant and all co-applicants</li>
  <li>Risk gradation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Form Submission Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A form cannot be submitted unless all mandatory fields are filled.
    Any field-level validation failures are displayed as front-end errors.
  </li>
  <li>
    After completing each form, the BCM must close the corresponding task
    by clicking the tick button against that form.
    Until this action is completed, the verification is not treated as complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    A form can be edited only until its corresponding task is marked complete.
    Once the task is completed, the form becomes non-editable.
  </li>
</ul>
