<h2>Partially Disbursed: Subsequent Tranches</h2>

<h3>Partially Disbursed Stage: CO</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CO can locate a partially disbursed case from the <strong>All cases</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>CO can create a new disbursement request directly from <strong>All cases</strong>. No case or task assignment is required.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pending Balance</strong> =
    {Net Payment Amount − Sum of all previously disbursed tranche amounts}
  </li>
  <li>CO creates the disbursement request based on the pending balance.</li>
  <li>Tranche amount cannot exceed the pending balance.</li>
  <li>Disbursement date, payment mode, and split payment logic are the same as the <strong>Ready for Disbursal</strong> stage.</li>
  <li>Tranche editing, deletion, and movement are allowed only for the active tranche.</li>
  <li>These actions are permitted only while the disbursement task is in the CO’s queue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partially Disbursed Stage: BPO</h3>
<ul>
  <li>BPO receives a new <strong>BPO checklist questionnaire</strong> on the <strong>Primary Verifications</strong> tab for the active tranche.</li>
  <li>BPO checklist questionnaires for previous tranches remain in <strong>Completed</strong> state and are non-editable.</li>
  <li>BPO receives a new <strong>BPO checklist</strong> on the <strong>Checklist</strong> tab for the active tranche.</li>
  <li>Checklists for previous tranches remain completed and non-editable.</li>
  <li>Disbursement task movement to Ops or send-back to CO follows the same logic as the <strong>Ready for Disbursal</strong> stage.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partially Disbursed Stage: Ops</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ops receives a new <strong>Ops checklist questionnaire</strong> on the <strong>Primary Verifications</strong> tab for the active tranche.</li>

  <li>Ops receives a new <strong>Ops checklist</strong> on the <strong>Checklist</strong> tab for the active tranche.</li>
  <li>Ops checklists for previous tranches remain completed and non-editable.</li>

</ul>
