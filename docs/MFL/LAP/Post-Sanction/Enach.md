<h2>E-NACH</h2>

<p>E-NACH can be initiated by CO on the <strong>E-Registrations</strong> tab.</p>

<p>E-NACH can be performed via two modes: <strong>Online</strong> &amp; <strong>Offline</strong></p>

<h3>Online NACH</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CO can initiate online NACH via dashboard.</li>
  <li>On initiation, CO gets the mandate link on the dashboard. In parallel, the customer receives an SMS with the E-NACH link from Digio.</li>
  <li>Customer or CO can open the link and complete the E-NACH process.</li>
  <li>Customer can see the bank account details verified from Penny drop.</li>
  <li>Customer can choose one of the following E-NACH set-up modes: Debit card, Net banking, or UPI.</li>
  <li>System waits for the webhook from Digio which updates the UMRN. Until this is received, the system blocks the user from moving forward. User is on wait screen.</li>
  <li>Once webhook is received, customer/CO receives a success confirmation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Offline NACH</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CO can initiate offline NACH via dashboard.</li>
