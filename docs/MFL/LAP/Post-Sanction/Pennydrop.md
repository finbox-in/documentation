<h2>Penny Drop</h2>

<p>CO can initiate Penny drop on the <strong>E-registrations</strong> tab. While initiating, CO gets an option to select one out of the bank accounts added in the application for applicant and co-applicants. Currently, the system only shows the bank accounts for the primary applicant. (Fix to be implemented)</p>

<p>After selecting a bank account, CO has to re-enter the bank account number in a text field, with the last 4 digits validated against the account number extracted from the bank statement or the manually entered account number. The bank name is also validated along with the bank account number.</p>

<p>Penny drop can be performed on only one account. The same account is used for <strong>E-NACH</strong> and money deposit after disbursal.</p>

<p>Currently, Penny drop is done using <strong>Zoop service</strong> (to be moved to Digio).</p>

<p>Currently, Penny drop can be initiated via the dashboard on a sidebar (journey screen). Planned improvements include bringing the whole experience to the dashboard for a seamless workflow.</p>

<p>If Penny drop fails, CO can retry it on the sidebar. (User experience improvements for failure scenarios are planned)</p>
