Additionally FinBox also provides a **Dashboard** to manage loan applications.

In this documentation, we refer the **origination partner** as **"sourcing entity"**. The sourcing entity acquires and bring the customer to initiate the loan journey, while **"lender"** is the entity that approves and give loan.

Please head to respective guides for entity:
- [Sourcing Entity](/middleware/sourcing-entity.html)
- [Lender](/middleware/lender.html)
