# Lender
A Lender can access high-quality leads from FinBox platform via a dashboard and can also integrate FinBox APIs to integrate directly with their LOS/ LMS.

Lenders can configure their API endpoints for underwriting and in case they do not have an API available and are comfortable sharing the credit policy, FinBox can evaluate lender specific credit policy and display on the dashboard.

Please refer to [REST API](/middleware/lender-rest-api.html) guide to integrate existing LOS / LMS with Lending Middleware.
